# Course Description, Goals and Expectations

* Catalog description: introduction to the formulation of research questions covering crime and justice, research designs, data collection, and interpretation and reporting in criminological and justice-system settings.
* My description: Research methods is often viewed as a "technical" or "how-to" course but it's so much more than that. At a deeper level, it's about the use of the scientific method (yes, that same one you learned about in grade school) to answer questions and develop knowledge. The rules of logic, the practice of asking "how do you know that?", the process of critically evaluating evidence, and ethical conduct in doing these things are all issues we cover in this course.
* At the end of this semester, you should have increased proficiency in (1) the goals and ethics of research; (2) the linkages between theory and research (including the differences between inductive and deductive research); (3) explaining the distinctions between concepts and variables; (4) evaluating a study's measurement strategy; (5) evaluating a study's research design; (6) critically analyzing the evidence in support of a study's conclusions; and (7) describing the strengths and weaknesses of a study.

# Grades

*  Final grades: I will not be using plus/minus grading in this course. Each graded item this semester will be on a 100-point scale. At the end of the semester, I will assign letter grades based on the following cutoffs:

| Numeric Grade | Letter Grade |
|----------:|:-------------:|
| 90 and above |  A |
| 80-89 |  B |
| 70-79 |  C |
| 60-69 |  D  |
| 59 and below | F   |

* Grade components: throughout the semester, I will assign numeric grades which will contribute to your final course grade. The weights for the individual components are:

| Item | % Weight |
|:----------|-------------:|
| Exam 1 | 25% |
| Exam 2 | 25% |
| Exam 3 | 25% |
| Assignment #1 | 8.33% |
| Assignment #2 | 8.33% |
| Assignment #3 | 8.33% |

# Exams and Assignments

* Exams will be in-class, pencil/pen-and-paper format and will cover the material since either the beginning of the class (exam 1) or since the last exam (exams 2-3).
* Material for the exams will come from the lectures (see below) and assigned readings.
* I tend to overweight the material I cover in lecture (especially lecture material that specifically covers the assigned readings) on the exams; so I would recommend that you overweight your studying in a similar way.
* The final exam (exam 3) will be administered during the scheduled final exam period for this course which is Monday 5/11/26 (10:30-11:45am; location TBD).
* I will provide a few practice questions before each exam.
* Each exam will be comprised of multiple choice, true-false, and open-ended short answer questions.
* For each assignment, you will be asked to address a specific criminology or criminal justice problem. In addition to addressing/solving the problem, I will ask you some questions about the problem and your answers to these questions will be part of the assignment grade.
* You will have 2 days to work on each assignment; when the assignment is due, you will submit it in class.
* Assignments can be typed or handwritten. Regardless of how you submit it, it should be organized and legible so I can read it.
* You will need a calculator for exams and assignments in this class. The calculator must be able to take square roots.
* Assignments must be submitted in class on paper. I do not accept assignments submitted electronically.
* If you have to miss a class session when there is an exam or an assignment is due, the absence must be excused in accordance with the University's Course Related Policies and Resources for Undergraduate Students. For excused absences, I require appropriate documentation to support the excuse.

# Readings and Lectures

* Throughout the semester, I will assign various readings from the textbook and I will cover certain parts of these readings in class.
* I will post lecture notes on this webpage throughout the semester so you should bookmark this page and refer to it on a regular basis.
* If you have to miss a regular class session (no exam and no assignment due), it will be important for you to consult with another student taking the class to make sure you get the material I covered in class when you were absent (The notes I post on this webpage should not be viewed as a substitute for coming to class).
* If you're ever confused about course material, you should come by and ask questions during office hours. If you have a class conflict and can't attend office hours, we can set up an appointment at a mutually convenient time.

# Accessibility Accommodations

* I commit to abiding by and implementing any approved accommodations for persons with disabilities.
* It is your responsibility to consult with the Accessibility and Disability Service (ADS) Office which is located in Shoemaker Hall.
* After your consultation, the ADS Office will transmit your approved accommodations to me.
* After I have received your accommodations from the ADS office, you and I must meet to discuss implementation.

# Academic Integrity

If credible evidence of a rule violation materializes, it will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in accordance with the University's Academic Integrity Policy. Please note that an Academic Integrity referral does not mean that you have been found responsible for a violation or that I have concluded you are responsible for a violation. It means that an issue of concern has been noted and that the Office of Student Conduct will examine it. A determination of responsibility will only be reached after the Office of Student Conduct has completed its investigation with appropriate due process; as an instructor, my role in the process is a limited one.

## Lesson 1 - Thursday 1/28/26

1. An important theme in the first part of chapter 1 (pp. 1-5) is the idea of relying on common sense as a source of understanding.
2. I want to provide an example of how we might use the tools of science to address a common-sense hypothesis.
3. A [CNN story](https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/26/politics/fbi-comey-crime-police) posted in October of 2015 made the point that increased scrutiny of law enforcement in the wake of the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson MO (August 2014) and the Freddie Gray killing in Baltimore (April 2015) might be contributing to reduced proactive policing which, in turn, could lead to a rise in crime: "At the same time, a number of high-profile police shooting incidents, many caught on ubiquitous camera phones, have given rise to protests over policing tactics that critics call heavy-handed. In some cities, police officers privately report holding back on making stops for fear of ending up the next YouTube 'bad cop' sensation. They call it the Ferguson effect."
4. If this hypothesized "Ferguson effect" really exists, we might expect that murder rates in American cities would increase from 2013 to 2015.
5. There are many ways a hypothesis like this could be tested; we will consider one way pioneered by David Pyrooz and his colleagues ([Pyrooz, Decker, Wolfe, and Shjarback, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235216300010)) .
6. Let's begin by looking at each of the 82 American cities that had at least 250,000 population in any of the years 2013, 2014, or 2015.
7. Next, we consider the concept of a "murder rate."
8. Let the murder rate be the number of murders known to the police divided by the population size for that city for a particular year, say 2013 or 2015; note that this fraction will be a very small number so it is conventional to multiply the fraction by 100,000 to give us the number of murders per 100,000 population.
9. Then, let's examine the the murder rates in 2013 and 2015 for each of the 82 cities.
10. Here are the first 4 cities:

| City | 2013 Murders | 2013 Population | 2015 Murders | 2015 Population | 2013 Rate | 2015 Rate | +/- |
|:-----|-------------:|----------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------:|----------:|----:|
| Albuquerque | 37    | 558,165         | 43           | 559,721         | 6.629     | 7.682     | +   |
| Anaheim     | 11    | 345,320         | 18           | 349,471         | 3.185     | 5.151     | +   |
| Anchorage   | 14    | 299,455         | 26           | 301,239         | 4.675     | 8.631     | +   |
| Arlington   | 18    | 378,765         | 8            | 387,565         | 4.752     | 2.064     | -   |

11. Here are the last 4 cities:

| City | 2013 Murders | 2013 Population | 2015 Murders | 2015 Population | 2013 Rate | 2015 Rate | +/- |
|:-----|-------------:|----------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------:|----------:|----:|
| Tulsa          | 60    | 394,498         | 55           | 401,520         | 15.209    | 13.698    | -   | 
| Virginia Beach | 17    | 450,687         | 19           | 452,797         | 3.772     | 4.196     | +   |
| Washington DC  | 103    | 646,449         | 162         | 672,228         | 15.933     | 24.099   | +   |
| Wichita        | 15    | 386,486         | 27           | 389,824         | 3.881     | 6.926     | +   |

12. If we consider all 82 cities, we find that 48 of the cities experienced an increase in the homicide rate from 2013-15, while 30 experienced a decrease.
13. You might have noticed that 30+48 = 78, not 82. What happened to the other 4 cities?
14. The 4 "missing" cities are: Honolulu, Newark, Portland, and Raleigh; there is not enough information to calculate the murder rate in both years for each of these cities.
15. Suppose we ignore the missing cities and just focus on the 78 observed cities and estimate p(a city's homicide rate increases from 2013 to 2015) as 48 divided by 78 which is 0.615.
16. This means there is a 61.5% chance that a city drawn at random experienced an increase in its murder rate from 2013 to 2015.
17. This provides support for the Ferguson Effect hypothesis since 0.615 is greater than 0.5 (which would imply an equal chance of an increase or a decrease from 2013 to 2015).
18. We can also calculate a 95% confidence interval around the 0.615 estimate; this confidence interval is [0.505,0.718].
19. Since this confidence interval *does not* include 0.5, we *reject* the null hypothesis that a city drawn at random from our 78 nonmissing cities has an equal chance of experiencing an increase or a decrease in its murder rate from 2013 to 2015.
20. So far, this is all pretty straightforward.
21. But there is the problem that we have 4 missing cities -- a problem we will need to revisit later.
22. My point in this discussion is to demonstrate that there is a principled way to use the tools of science to address significant policy questions.
23. We can also use the tools of science to deal with questions like "what factors might cause people to offend?" or "why do some people persist in offending while others stop?"
24. In general, we have to consider both the question that is being asked and the data that might be available to study the question.
25. Then, we need to be transparent about how we approach the question and the strengths and weaknesses of our approach; we will consider these issues when we meet (hopefully) on Tuesday!
