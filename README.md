# Course Description, Goals and Expectations

* Catalog description: introduction to the formulation of research questions covering crime and justice, research designs, data collection, and interpretation and reporting in criminological and justice-system settings.
* My description: Research methods is often viewed as a "technical" or "how-to" course but it's so much more than that. At a deeper level, it's about the use of the scientific method (yes, that same one you learned about in grade school) to answer questions and develop knowledge. The rules of logic, the practice of asking "how do you know that?", the process of critically evaluating evidence, and ethical conduct in doing these things are all issues we cover in this course.
* At the end of this semester, you should have increased proficiency in (1) the goals and ethics of research; (2) the linkages between theory and research (including the differences between inductive and deductive research); (3) explaining the distinctions between concepts and variables; (4) evaluating a study's measurement strategy; (5) evaluating a study's research design; (6) critically analyzing the evidence in support of a study's conclusions; and (7) describing the strengths and weaknesses of a study.

# Grades

*  Final grades: I will not be using plus/minus grading in this course. Each graded item this semester will be on a 100-point scale. At the end of the semester, I will assign letter grades based on the following cutoffs:

| Numeric Grade | Letter Grade |
|----------:|:-------------:|
| 90 and above |  A |
| 80-89 |  B |
| 70-79 |  C |
| 60-69 |  D  |
| 59 and below | F   |

* Grade components: throughout the semester, I will assign numeric grades which will contribute to your final course grade. The weights for the individual components are:

| Item | % Weight |
|:----------|-------------:|
| Exam 1 | 25% |
| Exam 2 | 25% |
| Exam 3 | 25% |
| Assignment #1 | 8.33% |
| Assignment #2 | 8.33% |
| Assignment #3 | 8.33% |

# Exams and Assignments

* Exams will be in-class, pencil/pen-and-paper format and will cover the material since either the beginning of the class (exam 1) or since the last exam (exams 2-3).
* Material for the exams will come from the lectures (see below) and assigned readings.
* I tend to overweight the material I cover in lecture (especially lecture material that specifically covers the assigned readings) on the exams; so I would recommend that you overweight your studying in a similar way.
* The final exam (exam 3) will be administered during the scheduled final exam period for this course which is Monday 5/11/26 (10:30-11:45am; location TBD).
* I will provide a few practice questions before each exam.
* Each exam will be comprised of multiple choice, true-false, and open-ended short answer questions.
* For each assignment, you will be asked to address a specific criminology or criminal justice problem. In addition to addressing/solving the problem, I will ask you some questions about the problem and your answers to these questions will be part of the assignment grade.
* You will have 2 days to work on each assignment; when the assignment is due, you will submit it in class.
* Assignments can be typed or handwritten. Regardless of how you submit it, it should be organized and legible so I can read it.
* You will need a calculator for exams and assignments in this class. The calculator must be able to take square roots.
* Assignments must be submitted in class on paper. I do not accept assignments submitted electronically.
* If you have to miss a class session when there is an exam or an assignment is due, the absence must be excused in accordance with the University's Course Related Policies and Resources for Undergraduate Students. For excused absences, I require appropriate documentation to support the excuse.

# Readings and Lectures

* Throughout the semester, I will assign various readings from the textbook and I will cover certain parts of these readings in class.
* I will post lecture notes on this webpage throughout the semester so you should bookmark this page and refer to it on a regular basis.
* If you have to miss a regular class session (no exam and no assignment due), it will be important for you to consult with another student taking the class to make sure you get the material I covered in class when you were absent (The notes I post on this webpage should not be viewed as a substitute for coming to class).
* If you're ever confused about course material, you should come by and ask questions during office hours. If you have a class conflict and can't attend office hours, we can set up an appointment at a mutually convenient time.

# Accessibility Accommodations

* I commit to abiding by and implementing any approved accommodations for persons with disabilities.
* It is your responsibility to consult with the Accessibility and Disability Service (ADS) Office which is located in Shoemaker Hall.
* After your consultation, the ADS Office will transmit your approved accommodations to me.
* After I have received your accommodations from the ADS office, you and I must meet to discuss implementation.

# Academic Integrity

If credible evidence of a rule violation materializes, it will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in accordance with the University's Academic Integrity Policy. Please note that an Academic Integrity referral does not mean that you have been found responsible for a violation or that I have concluded you are responsible for a violation. It means that an issue of concern has been noted and that the Office of Student Conduct will examine it. A determination of responsibility will only be reached after the Office of Student Conduct has completed its investigation with appropriate due process; as an instructor, my role in the process is a limited one.

## Lesson 1 - Tuesday 1/26/26, Thursday 1/28/26 & Tuesday 2/3/26

1. An important theme in the first part of chapter 1 (pp. 1-5) is the idea of relying on common sense as a source of understanding.
2. I want to provide an example of how we might use the tools of science to address a common-sense hypothesis.
3. A [CNN story](https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/26/politics/fbi-comey-crime-police) posted in October of 2015 made the point that increased scrutiny of law enforcement in the wake of the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson MO (August 2014) and the Freddie Gray killing in Baltimore (April 2015) might be contributing to reduced proactive policing which, in turn, could lead to a rise in crime: "At the same time, a number of high-profile police shooting incidents, many caught on ubiquitous camera phones, have given rise to protests over policing tactics that critics call heavy-handed. In some cities, police officers privately report holding back on making stops for fear of ending up the next YouTube 'bad cop' sensation. They call it the Ferguson effect."
4. If this hypothesized "Ferguson effect" really exists, we might expect that murder rates in American cities would increase from 2013 to 2015.
5. There are many ways a hypothesis like this could be tested; we will consider one way pioneered by David Pyrooz and his colleagues ([Pyrooz, Decker, Wolfe, and Shjarback, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235216300010)) .
6. Let's begin by looking at each of the 82 American cities that had at least 250,000 population in any of the years 2013, 2014, or 2015.
7. Next, we consider the concept of a "murder rate."
8. Let the murder rate be the number of murders known to the police divided by the population size for that city for a particular year, say 2013 or 2015; note that this fraction will be a very small number so it is conventional to multiply the fraction by 100,000 to give us the number of murders per 100,000 population.
9. Then, let's examine the the murder rates in 2013 and 2015 for each of the 82 cities.
10. Here are the first 4 cities:

| City | 2013 Murders | 2013 Population | 2015 Murders | 2015 Population | 2013 Rate | 2015 Rate | +/- |
|:-----|-------------:|----------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------:|----------:|----:|
| Albuquerque | 37    | 558,165         | 43           | 559,721         | 6.629     | 7.682     | +   |
| Anaheim     | 11    | 345,320         | 18           | 349,471         | 3.185     | 5.151     | +   |
| Anchorage   | 14    | 299,455         | 26           | 301,239         | 4.675     | 8.631     | +   |
| Arlington   | 18    | 378,765         | 8            | 387,565         | 4.752     | 2.064     | -   |

11. Here are the last 4 cities:

| City | 2013 Murders | 2013 Population | 2015 Murders | 2015 Population | 2013 Rate | 2015 Rate | +/- |
|:-----|-------------:|----------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------:|----------:|----:|
| Tulsa          | 60    | 394,498         | 55           | 401,520         | 15.209    | 13.698    | -   | 
| Virginia Beach | 17    | 450,687         | 19           | 452,797         | 3.772     | 4.196     | +   |
| Washington DC  | 103    | 646,449         | 162         | 672,228         | 15.933     | 24.099   | +   |
| Wichita        | 15    | 386,486         | 27           | 389,824         | 3.881     | 6.926     | +   |

12. If we consider all 82 cities, we find that 48 of the cities experienced an increase in the homicide rate from 2013-15, while 30 experienced a decrease.
13. You might have noticed that 30+48 = 78, not 82. What happened to the other 4 cities?
14. The 4 "missing" cities are: Honolulu, Newark, Portland, and Raleigh; there is not enough information to calculate the murder rate in both years for each of these cities.
15. Suppose we ignore the missing cities and just focus on the 78 observed cities and estimate p(a city's homicide rate increases from 2013 to 2015) as 48 divided by 78 which is 0.615.
16. This means there is a 61.5% chance that a city drawn at random experienced an increase in its murder rate from 2013 to 2015.
17. This provides support for the Ferguson Effect hypothesis since 0.615 is greater than 0.5 (which would imply an equal chance of an increase or a decrease from 2013 to 2015).
18. So far, this is all pretty straightforward.
19. But there is the problem that we have 4 missing cities -- a problem we will need to revisit later.
20. My point in this discussion is to demonstrate that there is a principled way to use the tools of science to address significant policy questions.
21. We can also use the tools of science to deal with questions like "what factors might cause people to offend?" or "why do some people persist in offending while others stop?"
22. In general, we have to consider both the question that is being asked and the data that might be available to study the question.
23. Then, we need to be transparent about how we approach the question and the strengths and weaknesses of our approach; we will consider these issues when we meet (hopefully) on Tuesday!

*Note*: There is a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/IDort0fxBSE) summarizing the material in the syllabus and on this webpage so far since we were unable to meet during the first week of class. Please use the CC button if you need captioning. 

### Another Example

24. A significant amount of research has studied the effects of the death penalty on murder rates.
25. Some research indicates that the death penalty is a deterrent; other research suggests that the death penalty actually increases murder rates.
26. Still other research finds no effect.
27. How might we go about testing this idea?
28. What happens to homicide rates when a state abolishes the death penalty?
29. We can see when states abolished the death penalty by going to the [Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC)](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state).
30. Next, we look up the homicide rates at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wonder.cdc.gov).

| State | Year of Abolition  | Pre-Rate | Post-Rate | Sign |
| :-----|-----:| ---: |---: |---: |
| Colorado | 2020 | 4.3 | 6.3 | + |
| Connecticut | 2012 | 3.8 | 2.8 | - |
| Delaware | 2016 | 6.9 | 6.5 | - |
| Illinois | 2011 | 6.1 | 6.5 | + |
| Maryland | 2013 | 6.9 | 6.5 | - |
| Massachusetts | 1984 | 3.4 | 3.5 | + |
| New Hampshire | 2019 | 1.5 | 1.0 | - |
| New Jersey | 2007 | 10.1 | 9.2 | - |
| New Mexico | 2009 | 7.5 | 7.4 | - |
| New York | 2007 | 5.0 | 4.6 | -  |
| North Dakota | 1973 | 1.0 | 1.9 | + |
| Rhode Island | 1984 | 3.8 | 3.9 | + |
| Vermont | 1972 | 2.2 | 1.5 | - |
| Virginia | 2021 | 6.2 | 7.5 | + |
| Washington | 2023 | 5.4 | 3.2 | - |

31. We treat each of these 15 abolition cases as a naturally occurring experiment.
32. The event of interest is whether the homicide rate increases after the death penalty is abolished.
33. Our null hypothesis, p0 = 1/2, asserts that homicide rates are equally likely to increase or decrease after the death penalty is abolished.
34. Our table shows that in 6 of the 15 experiments (40%), the homicide rate increased after the death penalty was abolished.
35. Question for you: if you flipped a coin 15 times and you got 6 heads/9 tails, would you question whether the coin is fair?
36. Let's consider some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

## Lesson 2 - Thursday 2/5/26

* In the first part of chapter 1, your textbook discusses several perceptions about crime and criminal justice that are not accurate.
* Example: females and older people "are the most heavily victimized of all groups."
* Let's take a look at recent data from the [National Crime Victimization Survey](https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/cv24.pdf) (table 3 on page 6).
* Example: crime today is high.
* Data from the Centers for Disease Control tell us that homicide rates were in 5 to 7 per 100k population range in the 1960's; during the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's those rates rose to over 10 homicides per 100k population; since the early 1990's they have dropped back to the 5 to 7 range with the exception of a brief period after COVID when those rates spiked; they have since [dropped back to 6.8 per 100k population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) (2023 rate).
* What seems to be "common sense" is sometimes incorrect.
* As the economist [Charles Manski has noted](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/pep/pep10.pdf) any conclusion that we draw is based on the sum of data + assumptions.
* The key to conducting and interpreting scientific research is that we are expected to convey the extent to which our conclusions depend on data and the extent to which they depend on assumptions.
* I will give an example from the state of Maryland.
* Did the homicide rate in Maryland increase or decrease from 2023 to 2024? (seems like a "yes" or "no" question).
* 2023 information: 548 homicides; the population is 6,180,253; the homicide rate is 8.867 homicides per 100,000 population.
* 2024 information: 491 homicides; the population is 6,263,220; the homicide rate is 7.839 homicides per 100,000 population.
* Looks like the rate went down.
* The problem is that there are deaths due to undetermined intent; there were 992 of these cases in 2023 and 649 of them in 2024.
* All the data can tell us is that the number of homicides could have been in the range of [548,548+992] in 2023 and [491,491+649] in 2024.
* However, many of these undetermined deaths are poisonings which could have been suicides or accidents.
* We may decide to *assume* that the poisoning deaths are suicides or accidents, not homicides.
* The new ranges if we make that assumption are [548,548+32] for 2023 and [491,491+38] for 2024.
* This means the ranges for the rates are [8.867,9.385] for 2023 and [7.839,8.446] for 2024; since the ranges don't overlap it looks like homicide rates decreased in Maryland from 2023 to 2024 but only if we make the assumption that the poisoning deaths are accidents are suicides.
* Again, conclusions = data + assumptions.
* Please read pp. 6-16 for next class. Thank you!

## Lesson 3 - Tuesday 2/10/26

* Is criminology a scientific discipline?
* What do we mean by the term *probabilistic causation*?
* Is criminology *interdisciplinary*?
* What does Bayley mean by the term "error proneness"?
* How do Hirschi and Selvin suggest we engage with error in the social sciences?
* What is a theory?
* How is a *paradigm* different from a theory? (example paradigms: (1) measuring crime; (2) sanction effects; (3) neighborhood crime dynamics).
* Is *methodology* a means to an end or an end unto itself?

---
* An example: what fraction of the population has been arrested at least once by age 23?; ([Brame et al., 2012; Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/129/1/21/31558)).
* Data from a nationally representative sample (the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth)
* Question asked at initial interview: have you ever been arrested or taken into custody by the police for an illegal or delinquent offense (do not include arrests for minor traffic violations)?
* Question asked at follow-up interviews: since the date of the last interview, have you been arrested by the police or taken into custody for an illegal or delinquent offense (do not include arrests for minor traffic violations)?
* These questions yielded 3 groups of people: (1) people who said they had been arrested (A = 1858); (2) people who said they had not been arrested (NA = 4299); and (3) people whose arrest status could not be discerned (DK = 1178).
* So, what is the fraction of people who have been arrested by age 23?
* We could ignore the DK people and calculate: A/(A+NA) = 1858/(1858+4299) = 0.302 (or 30.2%).
* What problems arise when we ignore the DK people?
* How could we incorporate the uncertainty induced by the DK people?
* Lower bound estimate: A/(A+NA+DK) = 1858/(1858+4299+1178) = 0.253 (or 25.3%).
* Upper bound estimate: (A+DK)/(A+NA+DK) = (1858+1178)/(1858+4299+1178) = 0.414 (or 41.4%).
* Notice that the difference between the upper bound and lower bound is 0.414-0.253 = 0.161.
* Also, notice that the fraction of the total cases in the DK category is 1178/(1858+4299+1178) = 0.161.
* This equality is not a coincidence; it means that the more missing cases we have, the wider the difference between the upper and lower bounds will be.
---

* Theory and research are intimately related to each other.
* The temporal relationship between the two dictates whether the science is proceeding in an *inductive* or *deductive* fashion (Paul Davidson Reynolds; *A Primer in Theory Construction*, 1972); I will use a slightly different framework for discussing these concepts in comparison to your textbook's treatment on page 16.
* According to Reynolds, when theory precedes research (i.e., research tests a theory), we are proceeding *deductively*.
* On the other hand, when research precedes (and informs) theory, we are proceeding inductively.
* What is the difference between *pure research* and *applied research*?
* What is *crime analysis* and how does it contribute to both criminology and criminal justice?

---
* An example: Suppose I tell you that a police chief decides to open a neighborhood police station. Then, we find that the average monthly number of neighborhood robberies in the year before the police station opened was 12.2; in the year after it opened the average monthly number of neighborhood robberies was 8.7. Based on this information, what conclusions can be drawn about the causal effect of the police station on the monthly robbery rates? What could be done to strengthen the analysis?
* In its discussion of *crime analysis*, (p. 11) your textbook distinguishes between "intelligence analysis", "operations analysis", and "investigative analysis"; what is meant by these terms?
* On page 12, your textbook introduces the term *evaluation research*. What kinds of policies and problems do criminologists and criminal justice researchers typically evaluate?
---

* We are close to the end of chapter 1; go ahead and finish the chapter for next time.
* Also, read pp. 25-34 of chapter 2 for next time.
* We will transition from chapter 1 to chapter 2 in our next class (Thursday 2/12/26).

## Lesson 4 - Thursday 2/12/26

* What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative research?
* The concept of *verstehen* is most commonly associated with: a. quantitative research; b. qualitative research; c. crime analysis; d. evaluation research
* Why does the book argue (p. 12) that *historicism* is antiscientific?
* Why does the book suggest that *scientism* is extreme positivism?
* Research methods terminology: causality, concepts, operationalization, variables (including independent and dependent variables), theories, and hypotheses.
* Your book uses an example of the Salvation House program (page 16).
* I will use a slightly different example:

---
* Example: Does residential placement reduce, increase, or have no effect on future offending among juveniles? ([Manski and Nagin, 1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0081-1750.00043)).
* Study of juveniles charged with crimes in Utah.
* 2 relevant theories: deterrence and labeling theory.
* Key concepts: residential placement and future offending (recidivism).
* Operationalization: juvenile court judges either assign kids to residential placement or return them to the custody of their parents/guardians; kids either return to juvenile court for a new offense or they don't.
* Measurement of independent variable: each juvenile who appeared in juvenile court at or before age 16 and were adjudicated delinquent were either assigned to residential placement or returned to parental/guardian custody; this decision was written down for each juvenile during the study period (N = 13,197).
* Measurement of dependent variable: each juvenile was followed for 2 years to determine whether they returned to juvenile court for a new offense; the outcome was written down for each of the 13,197 juveniles included in the study; if a juvenile returned to court within 2 years for a new offense, we say the juvenile recidivated; otherwise, we say there was no recidivism.
* Hypothesis to be tested: p(recidivism | residential placement) = p(recidivism | no residential placement)
* Finding: p(recidivism | residential placement) = 0.77; p(recidivism | no residential placement) = 0.59.
* What can we conclude based on this finding?

### Steps to Conduct a Research Project (pp. 16-21)

1. Identifying and describing the problem or question.
2. Developing a plan for how research data will be used to solve the problem or answer the question.
3. Collecting appropriate data (for example, we might use administrative, survey, or census data)
4. Analyze data and describe the study findings.
5. Draw conclusions, discuss strengths and weaknesses, and consider implications for future research and possibly for policy.

### Some Important Goals of Theory and Research (Reynolds, 1977)

1. Describe some scientifically interesting phenomenon.
2. Explain the past.
3. Predict the future.
4. Possibly exert some control over future events.

## Lesson 5 - Tuesday 2/17/26

* Reminder: I will be distributing the first assignment of the semester on Tuesday 2/24/26; it will be due on Thursday 2/26/26.
* We have completed Chapter 1 and are now turning to Chapter 2; you should have read to the end of Chapter 2 by end of this week.

### Practice for Assignment #1

* Go to the [FBI's Uniform Crime Reports webpage](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/publications).
* [Freddie Gray was killed by the Baltimore police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Freddie_Gray) in April 2015.
* Consider the hypothesis that police departments will reduce preventive enforcement (thereby leading to increased crime) when there is a highly publicized police killing.
* We will refer to this as the *depolicing hypothesis*.
* Click on the "Go to Offense Tables" link and consult Table 8 (you should do this for both 2014 and 2015).
* Calculate the number of murders per 100,000 population in Baltimore in 2014.
* Calculate the number of murders per 100,000 population in Baltimore in 2015.
* Calculate the percent change in the Baltimore murder rate from 2014 to 2015.
* Now, let's consider Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York City, and Richmond as control groups.
* Calculate the number of murders per 100,000 population in each of the control cities for 2014 and 2015.
* Calculate the percent change statistic in each of the control cities.
* Rounding rules: crime rates should be rounded to 3 decimal places and percent change statistics should be rounded to first decimal place.
* Make sure you put your results (# of murders, population, murder rate, percent change statistic) in an organized table.

### Chapter 2: Ethics in Criminal Justice Research

* This week's reading: Chapter 2 of the textbook. 
* Research often involves studies of human beings and animals.
* In this class, we focus primarily on ethical issues in the study of human behavior.
* Your textbook provides a series of "biomedical" and "social science" examples of ethical failures in research.
* Highlighted example: Tuskegee syphilis study (1932-1970s; page 25).
* Ethical hazard of consequentialism ("pull out all the stops"; page 25).

## Lesson 6 - Thursday 2/19/26

* Reminder: I will be distributing the first assignment of the semester on Tuesday 2/24/26; it will be due on Thursday 2/26/26.
* You should have be finished reading Chapter 2 by end of this week.
* For next week, you should read pp. 56-66 in Chapter 3.

### Chapter 2 (Continued)

* Key recurring themes in the ethical failures discussed in the first part of Chapter 2:

---
1. Research participants placed at risk of harm with no offsetting benefit to balance the risks.
2. Lack of consent and disrepect of the autonomy of research participants.
3. Inequitable distribution of benefits and burdens of research participants.
---

* The recurring nature of these problems led to a series of ethical principles articulated in the *Belmont Report* (discussed on page 40 which we will get to soon).
* Research fraud: intentional misrepresentation of research data, procedures, or results.
* Plagiarism: intentional appropriation of someone else's ideas or arguments without proper attribution.
* Multiple submission (sometimes called self-plagiarism).
* Researchers are expected to be objective (empirical vs. normative) and transparent (full disclosure of methods and procedures).
* Researchers are expected to faithfully adhere to approved protocols and procedures (promises made, promises kept).
* Honest mistakes do not constitute misconduct.
* Scientific knowledge is always provisional - subject to change if new evidence or new insights arise.
* Revision of scientific understanding is normal, not problematic.
* The work of researchers is subject to several kinds of review and oversight; important for researchers to be transparent and honest in all review interactions.
* Ethical codes from professional associations (ACJS example on pp. 37-38)
* Belmont Report (p. 40)

## Lesson 7 - Tuesday 2/24/26

* Today, we will finish chapter 2 and begin chapter 3.
* Your first assignment is being distributed today.
* You are asked to submit your completed assignment at the end of class on Thursday.
* Please review guidelines for assignments in the syllabus before you complete the first assignment.
* Reminder: exam 1 will be on Thursday 3/5/26; this will be an in-class exam; we will have some time for exam review on Tuesday 3/3/26.

### Assignment 1 - Due Thursday 2/26/26

* Go to the [FBI's Uniform Crime Reports webpage](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/publications).
* [Michael Brown was killed by the Ferguson Missouri police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Michael_Brown) in August 2014.
* Note that Ferguson is a suburb of St. Louis, MO so we will focus will be on the conditions in St. Louis compared to several control cities.
* Consider the hypothesis that police departments will reduce preventive enforcement (thereby leading to increased crime) when there is a highly publicized police killing.
* We will refer to this as the *depolicing hypothesis*.
* Click on the "Go to Offense Tables" link and consult Table 8 (you should do this for both 2013 and 2015).
* Calculate the number of murders per 100,000 population in St. Louis in 2013 (the year before Michael Brown was killed).
* Calculate the number of murders per 100,000 population in St. Louis in 2015 (the year after Michael Brown was killed).
* Calculate the percent change in the St. Louis murder rate from 2013 to 2015.
* Now, let's consider Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Memphis as control cities.
* Calculate the number of murders per 100,000 population in each of the control cities for 2013 and 2015.
* Calculate the percent change statistic in each of the control cities.
* Rounding rules: crime rates should be rounded to 3 decimal places and percent change statistics should be rounded to first decimal place.
* Make sure you put your results (# of murders, population, murder rate, percent change statistic) in an organized table.
* Murders are statistically rare so let's also look at robberies. We'll do the same tasks.
* Write a short essay (no more than 1 page) where you describe your procedures, your results, and your conclusions for both murder and robbery.
